# Library Management System Documentation

## Overview
The Library Management System is a comprehensive solution for managing library resources, including books, authors, genres, and publishers. The system provides functionality for tracking books, managing relationships between different entities, and handling library operations efficiently.

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **.NET 8.0**: Core framework
- **Entity Framework Core**: ORM for database operations
- **SQL Server**: Primary database
- **ASP.NET Core**: Web API framework

## Data Models

### BookModel
Primary entity for storing book information.

#### Properties
- `Id` (int): Primary key
- `Title` (string): Book title
- `ISBN` (string): Unique identifier
- `Description` (string): Book description
- `PublishedDate` (DateTime): Publication date
- `GenreId` (int): Foreign key to Genre
- `PublisherId` (int): Foreign key to Publisher
- `AuthorIds` (int[]): Collection of author IDs
- `BookAuthors` (ICollection<BookAuthorModel>): Many-to-many relationship with authors

#### Relationships
- One-to-Many with Genre
- One-to-Many with Publisher
- Many-to-Many with Authors (through BookAuthorModel)

### AuthorModel
Represents book authors in the system.

#### Properties
- `Id` (int): Primary key
- `FirstName` (string): Author's first name
- `LastName` (string): Author's last name
- `FullName` (string): Computed property combining first and last names
- `BookAuthors` (ICollection<BookAuthorModel>): Books written by the author

#### Relationships
- Many-to-Many with Books (through BookAuthorModel)

### GenreModel
Categorizes books by genre.

#### Properties
- `Id` (int): Primary key
- `Name` (string): Genre name
- `Books` (ICollection<BookModel>): Books in this genre

#### Relationships
- One-to-Many with Books

### PublisherModel
Represents book publishers.

#### Properties
- `Id` (int): Primary key
- `Name` (string): Publisher name
- `Books` (ICollection<BookModel>): Books from this publisher

#### Relationships
- One-to-Many with Books

### BookAuthorModel
Junction table for Book-Author many-to-many relationship.

#### Properties
- `BookId` (int): Foreign key to Book
- `AuthorId` (int): Foreign key to Author
- `Book` (BookModel): Navigation property
- `Author` (AuthorModel): Navigation property

## Database Design

### Tables
1. Books
   - Primary key: Id
   - Foreign keys: GenreId, PublisherId
   - Unique constraint on ISBN

2. Authors
   - Primary key: Id
   - Computed column: FullName

3. Genres
   - Primary key: Id
   - Unique constraint on Name

4. Publishers
   - Primary key: Id
   - Unique constraint on Name

5. BookAuthors
   - Composite primary key: (BookId, AuthorId)
   - Foreign keys to Books and Authors

### Constraints
- Cascade delete disabled for Genre-Book relationship
- Cascade delete disabled for Publisher-Book relationship
- Cascade delete enabled for Book-Author relationship

## API Endpoints

### Books
```
GET    /api/books          - List all books
GET    /api/books/{id}     - Get book by ID
POST   /api/books          - Create new book
PUT    /api/books/{id}     - Update book
DELETE /api/books/{id}     - Delete book
```

### Authors
```
GET    /api/authors          - List all authors
GET    /api/authors/{id}     - Get author by ID
POST   /api/authors          - Create new author
PUT    /api/authors/{id}     - Update author
DELETE /api/authors/{id}     - Delete author
```

### Genres
```
GET    /api/genres          - List all genres
GET    /api/genres/{id}     - Get genre by ID
POST   /api/genres          - Create new genre
PUT    /api/genres/{id}     - Update genre

```

## Business Rules

### Books
1. ISBN must be unique
2. Must have at least one author
3. Must have a genre and publisher
4. Title and ISBN are required

### Authors
1. First name and last name are required
2. Can be associated with multiple books
3. Cannot be deleted if associated with books

### Genres
1. Name is required and must be unique
2. Cannot be deleted if has associated books

### Publishers
1. Name is required and must be unique
2. Cannot be deleted if has associated books

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios
1. Duplicate ISBN
2. Invalid relationships
3. Deletion of entities with dependencies
4. Not found entities
5. Validation failures

### Error Response Format
```json
{
    "error": {
        "code": "string",
        "message": "string",
        "details": "string"
    }
}
```

## Data Validation

### Book Validation
- ISBN format validation
- Required fields check
- Relationship validation

### Author Validation
- Name format validation
- Required fields check

### Genre Validation
- Unique name check
- Required fields validation

### Publisher Validation
- Unique name check
- Required fields validation

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
1. Input sanitization
2. SQL injection prevention
3. XSS protection

### Authorization
1. Role-based access control
2. API endpoint protection
3. Resource-level permissions

## Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization
1. Proper indexing
2. Query optimization
3. Lazy loading configuration

### Caching Strategy
1. Entity caching
2. Query result caching
3. Cache invalidation rules

## Deployment

### Requirements
- .NET 8.0 Runtime
- SQL Server 2019 or later
- Minimum 4GB RAM
- 10GB storage

### Configuration
1. Database connection string
2. Application settings
3. Environment variables

### Environment-Specific Settings
```json
{
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Server=...;Database=..."
    },
    "Logging": {
        "LogLevel": {
            "Default": "Information"
        }
    }
}
```

## Maintenance

### Database Maintenance
1. Regular backups
2. Index maintenance
3. Data cleanup

### Monitoring
1. Performance metrics
2. Error logging
3. Usage statistics

## Future Enhancements
1. Book borrowing system
2. User management
3. Reservation system
4. Report generation
5. Integration with external book APIs
